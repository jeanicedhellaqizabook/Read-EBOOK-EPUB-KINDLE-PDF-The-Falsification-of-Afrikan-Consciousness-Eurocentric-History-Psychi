"[Exposes] the role Eurocentric history-writing plays in rationalizing European oppression of Afrikan peoples and in the falsification of Afrikan consciousness ... [and contends] that the alleged mental and behavioral maladaptiveness of oppressed Afrikan peoples is a political-economic necessity for the maintenance of White domination and imperialism."--Back cover.

Title: The late great Dr. Amos was giant in behavioral sciences
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2018
Review: The book is a masterpiece. The late great Dr. Amos was giant in behavioral sciences. He had a gift for taking complex subjects and making them simple to understand. I truly miss his teachings and thankful that he still can be seen on youtube. He still doesn't get the exposure he deserves which is truly sad. He should be required reading for any African American who needs to understand the depths of why we are the way we are.

Review: Dr Wilson (RIP) is one of most profound scholars of our time, while history is a absolute requirement in our becoming whole again what was done to Africans in AmeriKKKa from a psychological-mental-spiritual standpoint has not really been expounded on in the way Dr Wilson does it his Book BLACK POWER should be required reading in Black colleges around the country this man was ahead of his time and right on time at the same time, get his works whenever you can!!!

Title: Relevant material for cogitation.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2018
Review: This book will no doubt rub the wrong nerve of the guilty. Even they will at least give a hint of credit to facts and factoids contained. Empowering for any creed who feel the downtrodden of oppression. I would recommend this item as compulsory cogitation for high / secondary school students of African origin.

Title: Spendid take on Afrikan thinking...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2013
Review: One of the first lecturers I encountered when realizing the truth about the "history" we are taught, was Amos Wilson.

His words struck me to the core of my belief systems and awakened a thirst for knowledge that I can't seem to quench.

This book is the first of his books that I ordered and I had a hard time putting it down.

OK, we were lied to. OK, we were and are oppressed. For the first time, I can see clearly how the task of doing these things was accomplished by europeans. The psychological breakdown is truly something that should be heard by every Afrikan living in america.

Thanks Dr. Wilson, thank you Ancestors!

Review: Amos Wilson was the most brilliant African centered psychologist, historian to have lived. His grasp of language is absolutely beyond brilliant. If you want to understand the psychology of black people, this is the author to read. I don't think there are many intellectuals who can compare. All black people world wide and curious whites and others need to study his books. Mr. Wilson does a phenomenal job of reverse engineering white supremacy and its effects on black people worldwide. I would also add that he writes more about how blacks can empower ourselves rather than strictly blame whites. His books are no easy reads. He is very articulate. Enjoy the magnificence of one of the greatest living Africans. I feel so fortunate to have had the honor to have read his works. May Mr. Wilson rest in peace for eternity. Thank you Mr. Wilson
